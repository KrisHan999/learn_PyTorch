## Tensor Explained - Data Structures of Deep Learning



### What is a tensor?

The **inputs, outputs, and transformations** within neural networks are all represented using tensors, and as a result, neural network programming utilizes tensors heavily.



Use **nd-tensor to represent scalar, vertor, matrix, and nd-array**:

- scalar -> 0d-tensor

- vector -> 1d-tensor

- matrix -> 2d_tensor

- nd-array -> nd-tensor
